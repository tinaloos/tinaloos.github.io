## The Software Engineering Journey
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/.png"> Throughout the course of the Spring 2020 Semester, I had the privilege to learn a variety of software engineering concepts, such as problem analysis and design, team-oriented development, quality assurance, configuration management, and project planning. This class taught a lot more than just web application development. Through it, I learned how to be a better programmer and person. I discovered the importance of design patterns, ethics, agile project management, coding standards, open source software development, functional programming, development environments, and user interface frameworks.
