## The Software Engineering Journey
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/ss.png"> Throughout the course of the Spring 2020 Semester, I had the privilege to learn a variety of software engineering concepts, such as problem analysis and design, team-oriented development, quality assurance, configuration management, and project planning. This class taught a lot more than just web application development. Through it, I learned how to be a better programmer and person. I discovered the importance of design patterns, ethics, agile project management, coding standards, open source software development, functional programming, development environments, and user interface frameworks. In general, software engineering is was an intricate discovery of knowledge filled with hands-on experiences as well as trial and error. There are numerous aspects and tools of the trade. In order to deploy successful projects, testing must be conducted to ensure that there are no bugs and that everything runs smoothly.
