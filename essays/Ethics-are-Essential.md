## E for Ethics in Software Engineering
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/se.png"> In the scope of software engineering, ethics are principles that shape how a professional software engineer should conduct themselves, as well as how their projects should be morally created. Due to the fact that code is implemented in machinery, such as autonomous vehicles and medical equiptment, it is vital that the engineers behind the product take full precautions in order to ensure that only good results occur from each use. Software engineers should act and program righteously. They should not have malicious intentions, such as creating a trojan horse type of application or spyware that illegally extracts data from users. 

Since people may have different ideas on what "doing good" is, the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics Professional Conduc</a> and the <a href="https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics">IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics</a> has be implemented and enforced. Additionally, from taking ICS 390: Ethics in the Information Age, a computer scientist will learn that the following acceptable theories and frameworks may be used to evaluate the ethicality of a given situation: Virtue Ethics, Social Contract Theory, Kantianism, Rule Utilitarianism, and Act Utilitarianism. These are in place so that programmers make a meaningful contribution to society, be trustworthy, act honestly, fray from discrimination, implement fairness, respectfully innovate with creativity, design secure systems, and justfully maintain their software.

There have been incidents in society where programming errors caused human harm. For example, the accidents with Therac 25, a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine, led to over-radiation and patient deaths. This relates to the mishaps involving Tesla Version 7.0 with autopilot. Moral responsibility is placed on the software engineers in both conditions. Tesla, Inc. acted negligently by releasing a faulty automatic emergency braking system. The developers mistakenly labeled the vehicle as having a level 3 automation without realizing the hands-off problem, where the driver has barely enough time to take over the car in emergency situations. However, Therac 25 went out of commission while Tesla is continuing to develop new models with autopilot. 

Everyone has a conscience to determine the differendce from right and wrong. If everyone in society always acts with high moral standards, then society as a whole will be ethical. By practicing good works that benefit the community, we learn how to act responsibly. Software engineers have a very important job because they are in charge of developing the apps and websites that people all around the world can access anytime. Thus, there is a huge obligation for them to evalute the effects of their code of the lives of the users. Technology is prevalent in the 21st century and is always evolving. 


## The Private I in PrIvacy
<img class="ui small right circular image" src="../images/pi.jpeg"> According to social contract theory, all morally significant beings have the right to privacy in order for people to be autonomous moral agents and free citizens with healthy relationships. Privacy is a valuable social agreement where individuals should have control over their data. The moral capability of an AI machine to mimic ethical or unethical behavior is accomplished through human computer interfaces in devices that can understand and process natural language in order to interpret commands and implement operations (Misselhorn, 2018). AI virtual assistants have proven to be ethical despite difficulties of maintaining privacy in the Information Age. Limitations on artificial general intelligence devices lead to unvirtuous results through accidental task operations and data breaches (Karppi, 2019).
