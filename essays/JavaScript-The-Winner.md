## Java vs JavaScript

Prior to this semester, I have primarily coded in Java throughout my previous ICS courses. Although I am a newbie to the language of JavaScript, I enjoy using it to code. Java and JavaScript both have different purposes, where each comes out as superior. Java is an object-oriented programming language where the type of variable being used must be defined in the declaration. In JavaScript, the rules are more relaxed. This allows JavaScript to be more user-friendly and assists as a client-side language for scripting. Java operates on server based applications, mobile devices, desktop and web applications such as games, along with databases. Due to my interest in web development, I find JavaScript to be more useful.  

From an engineering perspective, JavaScript is a great programming language. First, it is an object based scripting language that allows a programmer to code objects and their relationships in the context of each other. Secondly, it supports front-end development; it can be embedded directly into an HTML framework or library. Third, in addition to the client, JavaScript can be used on the server for back-end development such as a Node.js powered servers. JavaScript is commonly used on websites and is also known as the programming language of HTML. Websites are developed in JavaScript along with HTML and CSS to create appealing and user friendly interactive websites. 

## Athletic Software Engineering

In High School, I played two sports: tennis and cheerleading. I believe that a great way to improve skills and get better at a craft is to continually practice it. As the saying goes, "practice makes perfect". By contiually rehearsing a behavior, I am prompted to achieve Rx time in the WODs. I am motivated to putting in at least 10-20 hours a week on this course, in order to refine my programming abililities. Although I prefer to take my time quadruple-checking my work and code to ensure that there are no errors, being placed in a time-constrained and high-intensity enviornment will inspire me to work effectively and efficiently. I agree that competency is key in order to have the proper knowledge to code with ease and focus on process and deisgn problems rather than implementation concerns. 

## WODs

Although the WODs (Workout of the Day)s are stressful, they are also enjoyable because I am assured that I have gained more knowledge about software engineering. The WODs will help me gain confidence and exercise my brain muscles. The practice WODs are extremely beneficial because they mirror the enviornment of the actual in-class WODs. The WODs put students on the spot and prepare us for real-world experiences, such as technical interviews where the company is looking for programmers who can produce a consise and correct solution. After completing the first set of practice, group, TA, and
