My interest in coding began in high school as an AspireIT peer-leader. I wanted to encourage others to create codes of fun that achieve simple tasks. By leading an afterschool coding camp that achieved creative animations, I was able to share my interest in coding with others.

The next step is to approach software engineering by combining theoretical and practical design and development strategies from engineering and computer science. Modeling design-based algorithms combined with data structures compose analytical and problem-solving procedures that enable the creation and maintenance of applications.

The application lifecycle revolves around quality compliant design specifications that create a continuous review, maintenance, analysis, and testing of software functions. Producing creative software that is easy for humans to interact with is a challenging process for software teams.

"Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But itâ€™s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."
-Steve Jobs

This quote motivates me to acquire the design and implementation skills necessary to achieve successful projects that solve real world problems.
