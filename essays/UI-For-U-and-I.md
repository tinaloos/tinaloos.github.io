## Sematic UI Framework - It Works!

The Semantic UI framework is complex. However, it allows the programmer to take the website that they are developing to the next level. With Semantic UI, aesthetically pleasing designs can be brought to the worldwide web. Due to this, raw HTML and CSS documents are utilized in order to transform basic webpages into beautifully crafted sites. My first experiences with Semantic UI on PluralSite was an insightful experience where I gained insight on how to implement elements, collections, dropdown menus, and more. Now, I enjoy attempting to re-create sites using my new knowledge. Although learning UI frameworks is as intricate as learning new programming languages, the daunting task is worthwhile.

## Wow!
