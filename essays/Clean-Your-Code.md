## Check for Success 

ESLint is a code analysis and quality assurrance tool that verifies that the programmer's code adheres to coding standards. After my first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I enjoy the satisfaction of seeing the green checkmark in the righthand corner of the screen and am motivated to write precise and clean code. I find it very helpful in insuring that my code is properly formatted. Software engineers are told the location of their error and are given a description that provides insight how the mistake can be fixed. This makes is easier to locate and smash bugs. An example of an ESLint error is "ESLINT: Too many blank lines at the end of the file. Max of 0 allowed.(no-multiple-empty-lines)". Thus, when the user sees this, all they need to do is press delete (on Mac) on extra line to remove it. The green checkmark is not painful, but rather very useful. Without it, there could be stylistic errors in my code that are preventing it from running properly or being easily readable. This helps ensure that the implementation of the program will be successful. With the green checkmark comes accuracy and consistency. Without the green checkmark, I would not instantaneously know if my code is syntactically correct or not. 

## Learn the right Way

I truly believe that having proper code is aesthetically pleasing and improves the programâ€™s quality. Writing appropriately formatted code is a great technique that all software engineers should incorporate. Coding standards are very important. When everyone follows the guidelines, then we can better understand how a program operates when reading other code. For example, when we define functions and variables with names that describe their purpose, then when an outside user attempts to comprehend our code, they are better able to make sense of it. Although it may sometimes be a struggle to maintain the precise number of curly braces, parentheses, brackets, and semicolons, it is a learning experience that helps us become better and more efficient software engineers. Absorbing all of the knowledge on how to suitably write code may be tedious, but it is exceptionally beneficial in the long run. Although it takes a little extra time to download sample.eslintrc into the project directory, and rename it to .eslintrc, change directories into the project directory, and run npm install to install ESLint, this is a vital step in the process. Learning how code should be written definitely helps one learn a programming language.

## Consistency is Key

Although there are multiple ways to write a program that results in the same output, having a consistent style of writing is vital in ensuring that code is legible and decipherable by all. When multiple software engineers are coding a project together, having a similar method of writing code prevents conventions and mistakes such as mixing up variable names or forgetting a bracket. It was interesting having to install NodeJS and NPM and configuring the default settings for JavaScript and ESLint because without it, users may be left in the dark if their code composition is accurate or not. This is similar to spelling and grammar checks in Microsoft word when writing essays or research papers. If a paper does not comply with MLA or APA format, then the composition is not acceptable. With a proper implementation of coding standards, complexity is minimized, the probability of errors and failure are reduced, and ease of maintenance is warranted.
