## Check for Success 

After my first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I enjoy the satisfaction of seeing the green checkmark in the righthand corner of the screen and am motivated to write precise and clean code. ESLint is code analysis tool that checks that the programmer's code adhears to coding standards. I find it very helpful in insuring that my code is properly formatted because the software engineer is told where their error is and a description to provide insight on where they went wrong. An example of an ESLint error is "ESLINT: Too many blank lines at the end of the file. Max of 0 allowed.(no-multiple-empty-lines)". Thus, when the user sees this, all they need to do is press delete (on Mac) on extra line to remove it. I truly believe that having proper code is aesthetically pleasing and improves the quality. This is a great technique that all software engineers should incorporate.
