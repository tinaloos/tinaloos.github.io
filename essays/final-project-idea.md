## Project: UH Connnected

## Overview
*The problem:* The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed all courses in the UH system, and nationally, to use an online format of learning in order to prevent the spread of disease and flatten the curve. Although this is essential for the health and safety of students, it is also important for the community to remain connected to remain productive and vigilant while fighting the repercussions of the coronavirus.

*The solution:* Creating a hub where students can stay connected to further promote education and learning. For many classes, professors should utilize applications such as [Slack]( https://slack.com/), where students can easily pose questions, receive notifications from their professors, view necessary coursework to be completed, and have the opportunity to chat with any of their classmates without having to scout for contact information. With this, students will remain on-track with their assignments and still feel virtually connected while practicing their physical social distancing. 

## Approach
Students log in with their UH ID. 
Users can specify what courses they are taking, areas of interest, and what current city they are currently working from. Users can add themselves into different groups based on their information and will be notified when important announcements occur. 

Some possible mockup pages include:
* Landing page
* Student home page
* Admin home page
* Student profile page
* Calendar Page
* Community News / Discussion Page
* Browse users by courses, areas of interest, current city

## Use Case Ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

*New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
*Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.

## Beyond the basics
*Allow students to send invites to other users to join groups
