## Project: UH Connnected
## Overview
*The problem:* The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed all courses in the UH system, and nationally, to use an online format of learning in order to prevent the spread of disease and flatten the curve. Although this is essential for the health and safety of students, it is also important for the community to remain connected to remain productive and vigilant while fighting the repercussions of the coronavirus. In some courses, there is no easy way for students and professors to easily have a constant means of group communication with one another (other than email). Thus, they cannot experience full support outside of the classroom. 

*The solution:* The UH Connected application creates a hub where students can stay connected to further promote education and learning. For many classes, professors should utilize applications such as [Slack]( https://slack.com/), where students can easily pose questions, receive notifications from their professors, view necessary coursework to be completed, and have the opportunity to chat with any of their classmates without having to scout for contact information. With this, students will remain on-track with their assignments and still feel virtually connected while practicing their physical social distancing. It allows students to ogin and create a profile indicating their courses, major, areas of interest, and current city. The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or news articles that the user finds important or interesting. 

## Approach
Students log in with their UH ID and once a profile is created, others can browse the profiles.
Users can specify what courses they are taking, areas of interest, and what current city they are currently working from. Users can add themselves into different groups based on their information and will be notified when important announcements occur. 
Students can also set up notifications to find out new information automatically.
Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, and create new categories.
On the community news page, users can share updates on their life, as well as tips to have fun while on lockdown.

Some possible mockup pages include:
* Landing page
* Student home page
* Admin home page
* Student profile page
* Calendar Page
* Community News / Discussion Page
* Browse groups and users by courses, major, areas of interest, current city

## Use Case Ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

* New student goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
* Student goes to landing page, logs in, looks for their courses or groups they desire to join

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
* Allow students to send invites to other users to join groups
* Notify students when their name was mentioned in a chat
* Integrated map functionality so that users can post news updates in their area about the virus
* Support the organization of study sessions and vritual study or chat groups. Provide information on scheduled virtual events.
