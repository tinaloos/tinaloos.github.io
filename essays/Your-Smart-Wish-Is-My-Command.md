## Is Your Question Smart?

Smart questions are essential for software engineers to develop skills and become more enlightened with intelligence. The smartness of software engineers should reflect in their questions. According to Eric Raymond, in order for effective communication to exist within an open source community, certain guidelines must be followed. For example, questions should be precise, informative, and sent in accessible formats. Software engineers should have refined problem-solving skills that will assist them when coding, debugging, and working on projects. Asking questions the smart way is a vital craft. 

## How to Git the Answer You Need

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-do-i-undo-the-most-recent-local-commits-in-git

In this example, the question being asked is: “I accidentally committed the wrong files to Git, but I haven't pushed the commit to the server yet. How can I undo those commits from the local repository?”. It received 20530 upvotes. It did not place blame on the application and is properly written. It shows crisp details of the process that the user went through. The question also provided more information by having a link to Git, in case someone reading the question was unaware of the usage of Git. Proper tags were also included. This increased the ease of a reply.

The responses to this question provided great help to the developer in need. The responder took a lot of time to provide two options and a step-by-step process on how to undo a commit and redo. This exhibits that when a question is asked in a smart way, effective help follows as a result. The developed got the answer he was hoping for, indicated by the green checkmark, which shows that the developer accepted the response as correct. There are also 22257 upvotes on the answer, showcasing that numerous users found the solution to be useful. 

## Not So Smart  

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24722329/im-new-to-programming-in-java-and-my-code-wont-work-any-tips-please

Q: “i created this problem my self and i want this to work but it wont. can anyone please give me some advice?”
A: “Debugger is there, and for free. Use it.”
A: “You need to follow a tutorial first”

In this scenario, the user provided the code that was being worked using the Java programming language. The user needed help to divide two large numbers. However, the question reveals that the user has slight knowledge of how to code or write in English. For example, the variable c that was used in multiple lines was never declared. The question was careless and sloppily written.

In addition to the spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization errors in the question, the person asking the question lacks knowledge of basic Java programming skills, such as adding a semicolon at the end of a declaration statement, properly placing curly brackets to compile with coding rules, and the difference between a string and an integer. The user was not professional in his writing and should have taken time to properly construct his sentences. Although the user showed some courtesy by using the word “please”, the question was not clear or precise. According to Eric Raymond, polite ambiguity is valued less than being technical and descriptive. Also, those who provided a solution were not thanked. The question may also be seen as a pointless query because it was asking for others to debug code without the type of problem. 

## The Pursuit of Knowledge  

>*"If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes."*
- Albert Einstein

As a result of this experiment, I have learned the importance of asking questions the proper way, in order to gain key insight. People have a higher probability of getting their important questions answered, if the query is asked in a polite and insightful manner. When asking for help, one should assure that time of others is appreciated and not wasted. Knowledge is power, and this power can be used to apply programming concepts and utilize technology to make the world a better place. Therefore, smart software engineers ask smart questions that lead to smart solutions.
