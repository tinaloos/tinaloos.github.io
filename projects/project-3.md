To code a final project for ICS 111 at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, I worked with two other team members: Darnell Domingo and Vince Khyla Rabang. The project was to create a game named Turtle Run that included the concepts of file reading, parsing, and array lists. It also involved both public and private member variables and functions. At the end, we conducted a live demonstration of how our game operates, by playing it in front of the class. This was the culmination of the projects generated in the course, after learning about file writing, 2D arrays, inheritance, interaction, storing data, interactivity, sound, and graphical user interfaces with [EZ Graphics](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/doc/). 

My contribution was that I created the classes labeled “Turtle.java” and “turtleRun.java”, which included the concepts of private, public member variables and member functions, in addition to the concepts of file reading and parsing to create the background. I coded a constructor to set the position of the turtle, an accessor method to retrieve the position of the turtle, and methods for moving the turtle in the direction of the key being pressed. Furthermore, I wrote the code to setup the EZ graphics system, score board, player, array of coins, and array of obstacles. I also ensured that everyone was on task and understood the material. Darnell’s contribution was that he created the class labeled “DDClass.java”, which also included the concepts of private, public member variables and member functions. Khyla’s contribution was that she created the class labeled “Obstacle.java”, which also includes the concept of private, public member variables and member functions, in addition to array lists. All team members communicated diligently and collaborated to design the game and merge the class(es) that we each wrote. The game ran by downloading the game from the assignment submission section of Laulima, unzipping the file and opening the Eclipse application, creating a new Java Project, importing the game file by copy and pasting the contents into a new Java Project, then clicking the triangle "run" button. Each team member was helpful and supportive of one another. We also learned about laptop screen recording an uploading a demonstration of our game to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt4nw94Tj1Y).  

From this experience, I developed my proficiency in the Java programming language and learned teamwork skills. Additionally, I gained knowledge in debugging/testing, algorithm development, problem solving, and implementation using object-oriented programming. My understanding of the fundamentals of computer science strengthened as I practiced coding with a modern programming language. My collaboration skills improved as I worked with my group members to create the fun and functional game. 

Game Instructions:
Wait a few seconds for the background images to load.
Use the “w”, “a”, “s”, “d” keys on your computer to move your hero, the turtle and avoid the mushrooms. 
The “w” key moves your turtle up.
The “a” key moves your turtle to the left.
The “s” key moves your turtle down.
The “d” key moves your turtle to the right.
The goal of the game is to move your turtle to the right-end of the screen without getting hit by the enemy mushrooms. 
Collects coins as much as you can and beat your highest score. 
If your turtle gets hits (comes into contact with) one of the moving mushrooms, you lose the game.
If you move your turtle to the right-end of the screen without getting hit by one of the mushrooms, you win the game.
Exit the game and run the program to play again.
