Cotton is a horror-esque text-based adventure game I developed using the functions and macros built from The Wizard's Game in [Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/). Slightly more interesting and convoluted! (It is not that scary.)

In a final project for ICS 111 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I worked with two other team members: Darnell Domingo and Vince Khyla Rabang. The project was to create a game named Turtle Run that included the concepts of file reading, parsing, public and private member variables and functions, and array lists. 

My contribution was that I created the classes labeled “Turtle.java” and “turtleRun.java”, which includes the concepts of private, public member variables and member functions, in addition to the concept of File Reading and Parsing. Darnell’s contribution was that he created the class labeled “DDClass.java”, which includes the concepts of private, public member variables and member functions. Khyla’s contribution was that she created the class labeled “Obstacle.java”, which includes the concept of private, public member variables and member functions. Also added Array Lists. All team members communicated diligently and collaborated to design the game and merge the class(es) that we each wrote. Each team member was helpful and supportive of one another. We also learned about laptop screen recording an uploading a demonstration of our game to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt4nw94Tj1Y).  

From this experience, I developed my profeciency in the Java programming language and learned teamwork skills. Additionally, I gained knowledge in debugging/testing, algorithm development, problem solving, and implementation using object-oriented programming. My understanding of the fundamentals of computer science strengthened as I practiced coding with a modern programming language. My teamwork skills

Game Instructions:

Running the game:
Download the game from the assignment submission section of Laulima.
Unzip the file and open your Eclipse application.
Create a new Java Project
Import the game file by copy and pasting the contents into your new Java Project.
Run the program.

Playing the game:
Wait a few seconds for the background images to load.
Use the “w”, “a”, “s”, “d” keys on your computer to move your hero, the turtle and avoid the mushrooms. 
The “w” key moves your turtle up
The “a” key moves your turtle to the left
The “s” key moves your turtle down
The “d” key moves your turtle to the right.
The goal of the game is to move your turtle to the right-end of the screen without getting hit by the enemy mushrooms. 
Collects coins as much as you can and beat your highest score. 
If your turtle gets hits (comes into contact with) one of the moving mushrooms, you lose the game.
If you move your turtle to the right-end of the screen without getting hit by one of the mushrooms, you win the game.
Exit the game and run the program to play again.
