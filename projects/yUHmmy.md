### UH Food Ordering & Restaurant Finding, Simplified

For my ICS 314 final project, my team and I created a web application called yUHmmy with the mission to implement social distancing for students on campus. Looking for somewhere to eat? There are many options on campus and in the surrounding Manoa area. Our platform puts them all in a single site and eliminates in-person and in-line waiting for customers by automating the process. Hungry students never have to wonder what restaurants are near UH, what food items are being sold at each place, or how much money they will have to pay for each item and in total. With the Covid-19 Pandemic among us, you may select what food items you would like to quickly pick up at restaurants.

Here are the features of the application:

* View available restaurants on campus and in the Manoa area
* View items on the menu, food descriptions, and prices at each location
* Search for the type of food you desire and find possible restaurants
* Order the food items that you are craving
* Create a profile page with food preferences and user information
* Rate restaurants with stars and provide your written feedback
* Integrated map functionality to discover top Manoa food locations
* Restaurant admin / vendor can view all orders in the queue
* Users check the queue to see if their order is ready
* The “I’m feeling hungry” button suggests where to eat, based on your preferences
* Today’s top 5 picks slideshow on homepage
