Scream. Run. Tell. is an organization that creates books and organizes workshops to teach children skills needed to protect themselves in times of danger. Through my volunteer work at the YWCA O'ahu, I was asked to re-design a website for the organization, to better reflect their values and personality. The original website design was dark-themed and not colorful enough to reflect the mission of the ogranization. 

During the summer of 2018, I worked with the Founder and CEO of the organization. I was in charge of gathering all of the data and information from the original site, and transfering it over to the new site. The CEO wanted to re-vamp their brand, while keeping true to their history.

The project helped me learn how to style and implement a web site, using templates that also fostered creativity. The website design was creates using [SqaureSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/), a drag-and-drop platform for website building and hosting. I learned about human-computer interation and the importance of proper web design, so that users can navigate sites with ease and have a positive interation with their devices.
